git-issue-1604e.dfy(65,37): Error: Could not prove that the bound variable 'go' satisfies the (non runtime testable) type GhostOrdinalCell after the range, where it's assumed to be of type Cell based on inferred bounds.
git-issue-1604e.dfy(24,24): [Related location] The constraint of GhostOrdinalCell is not run-time testable because it depends on the non-runtime-testable subset type GhostNaturalCell
git-issue-1604e.dfy(13,35): [Related location] The constraint of GhostNaturalCell cannot be tested at run-time because a call to a ghost predicate is allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the predicate with 'predicate method')
git-issue-1604e.dfy(65,103): Error: value does not satisfy the subset constraints of 'GhostOrdinalCell'
git-issue-1604e.dfy(67,37): Error: Could not prove that the bound variable 'go2' satisfies the (non runtime testable) type GhostOrdinalCell2 after the range, where it's assumed to be of type CompilableNaturalCell based on inferred bounds.
