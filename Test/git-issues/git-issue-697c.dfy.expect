git-issue-697c.dfy(18,11): Error: Could not prove that the bound variable 'c' satisfies the (non runtime testable) type EvenCell after the range, where it's assumed to be of type Cell based on inferred bounds.
git-issue-697c.dfy(9,26): [Related location] The constraint of EvenCell cannot be tested at run-time because a call to a ghost function is allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the function with 'function method')
