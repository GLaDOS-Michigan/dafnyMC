git-issue-1604f.dfy(38,8): Error: Could not prove that the bound variable 'f' satisfies the (non runtime testable) type SpecialFruit after the range, where it's assumed to be of type Fruit based on inferred bounds.
git-issue-1604f.dfy(16,31): [Related location] The constraint of SpecialFruit cannot be tested at run-time because a call to a ghost predicate is allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the predicate with 'predicate method')
git-issue-1604f.dfy(38,40): Error: possible violation of function precondition. Careful: variable f has type Fruit and not SpecialFruit because the range is compiled and SpecialFruit cannot be tested at run-time
